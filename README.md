# Epileptic Seizure Detection Using EEG

This project applies machine learning to automated detection of epileptic seizures from EEG signals. It leverages Python and open-source data science libraries to analyze EEG datasets, extract features, and build robust seizure classification models.

## Description

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, and timely, accurate detection is critical for managing patient risk. This repository provides code and resources to preprocess EEG recordings, apply feature extraction techniques, and train/test supervised learning models for classifying seizure vs. non-seizure states. The goal is to assist clinicians and researchers in developing effective and efficient seizure detection workflows with reproducible results.

## Features

- EEG data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction (time, frequency, and time-frequency domains)
- Multiple machine learning model implementations (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, ROC curves
- Jupyter Notebook environment for clear code organization and explanations

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- pip package manager

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amrit1005/Epileptic-Seizure-EEG-.git
   cd Epileptic-Seizure-EEG-
   ```

2. **Install required packages** (using requirements.txt if provided):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If a requirements file is not provided, install likely dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
   ```

3. **Open Jupyter Notebook** to run and interact with code:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Then, open the notebook files (`*.ipynb`) in your browser and follow code cells and comments.

## Usage

- Preprocess the EEG dataset and extract relevant features as described in the notebook.
- Train seizure detection models using the provided scripts.
- Validate results and visualize performance via metrics and graphs in the notebook.

**Example:**
1. Run preprocessing cells to clean and format data.
2. Execute cells for feature extraction and visualization.
3. Train models using the defined pipeline (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).
4. Evaluate predictions and examine performance metrics/output plots.

## Use Cases

- **Clinical Research:** Rapidly assess and validate automated seizure detection algorithms on new EEG datasets.
- **Healthcare AI Prototyping:** Integrate or benchmark new models and features in seizure diagnosis pipelines.
- **Educational:** Serve as a hands-on teaching tool for students and trainees exploring biomedical signal processing, deep learning, or medical AI.

## Technologies Used

- Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- Optionally: keras/tensorflow for neural networks
- Jupyter Notebook for reproducible research
